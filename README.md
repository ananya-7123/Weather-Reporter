# Weather-Reporter
A Voice-Based Weather Assistant built using Python that provides real-time weather updates for any city. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch live temperature and conditions, and SpeechRecognition with Pyttsx3 for interactive voice responses. A simple yet smart project demonstrating the blend of voice interaction and API integration.
